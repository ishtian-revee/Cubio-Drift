## Drawbacks

There are some major issues in the game. Users need to keep in mind these issues
to play and while playing the game. These are:

* **Resolution:** Before starting the game user need to set the screen resolution first.
Not all the resolution supports all the users machines. And also in some resolution
the game screen flickers and looks a bit low.

* **Level Access:** After name input all the levels are in unlocked state. Therefore
user can play these 3 levels at any time. Even they can play one level after another
without any score evaluation on the leaderboard.

* **Jumping Platform:** While playing some user will notice that after touching the
jumping platform by the box it goes up to screen.

* **Player High Jump:** While playing again some user will notice that at some times
the box jumps very high which was not suppose to be happened.

* **Main Menu Background Music:** After finishing any level the background music
of main menu gets turn off.
